# data_science_project3
3rd project in data science class on clustering by doing this on data set of movies for movie recommendations

Project 3 - Weekend movie trip

In this project we specifically examined data from Movielens
Taken from: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Instead of using the larger data sets that I started to use (hence the commneted code for the larger data sets) 
I instead decided to use the smaller of the two because of how much less time it takes to clean and normalize the 
data and also train the models.

Findings/Results:

I was very happy with the results of this project. I think they would have been a little better if I had used the larger dataset, but the clustering works splendidly. I had chosen both all of the tags that other users had placed upon the other movies, and I also used the average ratings of movies to determine how the movies should be clustered. With the results, I was able to enter a movie and have all related movies be output, with what I thought was very good accuracy of what movies were similar. The jupyter notebook has all of my code and notes on the process of getting to the endpoint. If I were to do this project again, I would take more time so as to be able to train it on the much larger dataset, I would also use the number of people who rated a movie as a clustering parameter, and I would also add the genre. By doing all of those, I believe that I would get a better clustering of movies. Finally, I would also test other clustering algorithms to see if they achieved better results.
